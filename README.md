#Unit 2: Ruby

In this unit, you will go into more depth into Ruby and really start problem solving. You will have to create your own tests and determine what it means to be successful with a challenge.

Since you've likely been suffering some Ruby withdrawal in unit 1, we recommend taking some time to review what you've learned as you need to. Go back to the [Socrates](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com) exercises you struggled with before and re-do them. Re-read pertinent passages in Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](http://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program). The Unit 2 challenges do not give you resources to read before hand, so you'll want to refresh your knowledge of Ruby on your own.

We also highly recommend selecting a Ruby book from the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/resources.md) to reference as you go through these challenges. You'll want to have a good understanding of the Ruby language. We often recommend the *Well-Grounded Rubyist*, but the other books are great as well.

##Twitter
You will start using Twitter during this unit to promote your blog posts rather than the google+ community. (This is required) If you would like an introduction to Twitter, check out our new [Twitter challenge](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-1/tree/master/week-1/10-twitter-intro.md)!


### [Week 4: Ruby Algorithms](week-4)
### [Week 5: Ruby Classes](week-5)  *Will be released the Friday prior to week 5*
### [Week 6: Object-Oriented Design](week-6) *Will be released the Friday prior to week 6*

## Expectations for the Unit

- [Peer-Pair program](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/peer-pairing_sessions.md) **at least 6 times**. Read about [pairing](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/pairing-in-phase-0.md) before hand.
- [Submit feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new) for all pairing sessions. (You should submit 6 for peer sessions and 1 for [GPS 2.1](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/guided-pairing-sessions.md))
- [Rate Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) at least 20 pieces of other people's feedback.

## [Resources](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/resources.md)
We highly recommend the following books for this unit. We aren't requiring you to purchase them, they are just great books to have in your library for really getting to know the ins and outs of Ruby and object-oriented design.
- [The Well-Grounded Rubyist](http://www.manning.com/black2/)
- [Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/)
