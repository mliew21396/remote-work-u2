#Unit 2: Ruby

In this unit, you will go into more depth into Ruby and really start problem solving. You will have to create some of your own basic tests.

### [Week 4: Ruby Algorithms](week-4/README.md)

Weeks 5 and 6 will be released on the Friday before the week.
<!-- ### [Week 5: Ruby Classes](week-5/README.md)
### [Week 6: Object-Oriented Design](week-6/README.md) -->
