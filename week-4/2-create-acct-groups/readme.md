# U2.W4: Accountability Group Creator!

## Learning Competencies
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Implement a method based on pseudocode
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes

## Summary

In this challenge, you are going to make a method that takes an array of names (you'll want to make a list from your Cohort page in Socrates) and outputs a list of accountability groups for three different units. You should try to get everyone into an accountability group of 4, but it's your decision how to deal with cohorts not easily divisible by four.

You will want to consider:
- Are there built-in methods to do this in Ruby?
- Will you try to avoid putting the same people together more than once?
- If I run this program three times in a row, will the program give me three different outputs? Is that good or bad?
- Should it remember past outputs or not?
- How do you decide when you're done? This is much more challenging than you probably think, especially since there are no tests.

We took you through the coding process in the last challenge. From now on, we will use these links to outline the process for each challenge.
