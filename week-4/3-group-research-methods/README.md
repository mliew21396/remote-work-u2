#U2.W4: Group Challenge: Research Methods

## Learning Objectives
- Research and use Ruby methods
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Explain how to use an existing Ruby method

## Summary
By now you have had some practice looking through the [Ruby Docs](http://ruby-doc.org/). I'm sure you've had some difficulty trying to figure out what methods do and how they work. You have probably also seen some people using methods you didn't know existed.

In this challenge, each member of your group will have a specific challenge and you will each practice reading through the docs to find existing `Enumerable`, `Hash`, or `Array` methods. You will then apply them to set arrays and hashes.

Research and test these methods out. You may want to play around with them in IRB to figure out exactly how they work before you can implement them properly.

Keep in mind the differences between destructive and non-destructive methods. Some of these methods should be destructive, and others should not. If you are confused about the difference between destructive and non-destructive methods, review the [Pad an Array](1-pad-array) challenge.


## Releases
## Release 0:
Refer to your accountability group spreadsheet to find your role.

Each person has a challenge to solve. This does not need to be done in any order.

If you have fewer than five accountability group members, only do as many of the challenges as you have people. Your goal is to learn how to use existing methods and teach others, not to learn specific methods. If you only have three people, only do the first three challenges.

Use the [Ruby Docs](http://ruby-doc.org/) find methods you can use
on arrays and a hashes, and use them to complete each goal.

Once you complete your challenge, Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your accountability group how to use the methods.

Each person will be working with the following `Array` and `Hash`:
```ruby
i_want_pets = ["I", "want", 3, "pets", "but", "only", "have", 2 ]
my_family_pets_ages = {"Evi" => 6, "Hoobie" => 3, "George" => 12, "Bogart" => 4, "Poly" => 4,
  "Annabelle" => 0, "Ditto" => 3}
```

#### Person 1: Find Matching Data
Create a method `my_array_finding_method` that takes an `Array` and a letter as arguments
and returns a new array of the words that contain that letter.

For example:
```ruby
my_array_finding_method(i_want_pets, "t") #=> should return ["want","pets","but"]
```

Create a method `my_hash_finding_method` that takes a `Hash` and number as arguments and
returns a new array of pet names by age.
Ex.
```ruby
my_hash_finding_method(my_family_pets_ages, 3) #=> should return ["Hoobie", "Ditto"]
```

#### Person 2: Modify Existing Data
I recently got a new pet, but I still want another! You'll need to create two destructive methods for this challenge.

Create a `my_array_modification_method!` that takes an array and number to be added to all
internal numbers. (Because you can never have too many pets!) It should permanently alter the original array and hash. For example:

```ruby
my_array_modification_method!(i_want_pets, 1)
#=> ["I", "want", 4, "pets", "but", "only", "have", 3]
```

Two years have passed since I made `my_family_pets_ages`, so the ages need to be updated. I want the original data to change since I can't travel back in time. For Example:

```ruby
my_hash_modification_method!(my_family_pets_ages, 2)
#=> {"Evi" => 8, "Hoobie" => 5, "George" => 14, "Bogart" => 6, "Poly" => 6, "Annabelle" => 2, "Ditto" => 5}
```

#### Person 3: Sort Data
I want to create a sorting method that alphabetizes an array. I also want to create a sorting method that arranges the data in my hash by age (starting with the youngest first). I want to see what happens when I do this, but I don't want it to modify the existing data.

```ruby
# i_want_pets was modified by person 2's code in this example
my_array_sorting_method(i_want_pets) #=>
[3, 4, "I", "but", "have", "only", "pets", "want"]


my_hash_sorting_method(my_family_pets_ages) #=>
[["Annabelle", 2], ["Ditto", 5], ["Hoobie", 5], ["Bogart", 6], ["Poly", 6], ["Evi", 8], ["George", 14]]
# Don't worry about the ages here. They were modified by person 2's method. 
# Your method just needs to sort the array.
```

#### Person 4: Delete Matching Data
Sometimes you no longer need data that matches something. Create a `my_array_deletion_method` that takes an array and a letter, and deletes all the strings that contain that letter. This should modify the original because we now permanently hate that letter.

For example:
```ruby
my_array_deletion_method!(i_want_pets, "a") # i_want_pets was modified by person 2's code in this example
#=> ["I", 4, "pets", "but", "only", 3]
```

Poor George passed away. He had a good life, but I need to permanently remove him from my list.

```ruby
my_hash_deletion_method!(my_family_pets_ages, "George")
#=> {"Evi" => 8, "Hoobie" => 5, "Bogart" => 6, "Poly" => 6, "Annabelle" => 2, "Ditto" => 5}
# Don't worry about the ages here. They were modified by person 2's method. 
# Your method just needs to delete the appropriate information the array.
```

#### Person 5: Split Data
At times, you will want to split data into two arrays based on a condition.

Create a `my_array_splitting_method` that will split the original array into two separate nested arrays (two arrays within one array). The first nested array should include all integers, and the second nested array should include all other values. This should not alter the original data structure.

For example:
```ruby
my_array_splitting_method(i_want_pets) # i_want_pets was modified by person 2's code in this example
#=> [4, 3],["I", "want", "pets", "but", "only", "have"]]
```

Then create a `my_hash_splitting_method` that will separate the hash into two arrays based on the value. It should return two arrays, the first which includes all pets who are five years of age or younger and the second that includes all other pets.T his should not alter the original data structure.

```ruby
my_hash_splitting_method(my_family_pets_ages, 5)
#=> [[["Hoobie", 5], ["Annabelle", 2], ["Ditto", 5]], [["Evi", 8], ["George", 14], ["Bogart", 6], ["Poly", 6]]]
# Don't worry about the ages here. They were modified by person 2's method. 
# Your method just needs to split the array as described.
```


## Release 1: Teach Others
Once you complete your challenge, identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
accountability group how to use the methods.

## Release 2: Commit and Push
Push your solution to GitHub!

You may want to email your accountability group your solution (and driver test code if you modified it).

## Release 3: Reflect
Use the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) and also discuss the following in the reflection section of the [my_solution](my_solution.rb) file:

What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?

## Release 4: Update your solution
When you get all of the solutions, paste them into your file as well. Review the solutions they created. Which existing methods did they use? Try to use them based on the instructions your group-mate included.

## Release 5: Commit and Push
Push your final solution to GitHub.
