# Ruby Collection Types and Enumerables

This week you will be working on writing command-line programs focusing on algorithms and basic testing. Some challenges will also have tests already developed using RSpec (a tool for testing Ruby code). You will learn how to run these tests on your computer and read them to decide whether you've successfully solved the challenge. NOTE: You are not expected to fully understand or write any RSpec in Phase 0, just be able to read it. RSpec is designed to be readable.

**Please make sure to follow each step we ask you (in order): write pseudocode, initial solution, refactoring, reflection.** If you want guidance on how to complete these steps, reference the links provided. If you have questions about any instructions, ask us.

If you haven't already purchased a copy of * The Well-Grounded Rubyist*, you'll want to do so. Take a look at [Week 3's bonus challenge](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-1/blob/master/week-3/11-BONUS-challenges/Well-Grounded-Rubyist.md) for info on which chapters to read and for a coupon code. You don't need to read every chapter thoroughly; skim where you need to. Take more time with concepts you don't feel comfortable with. DBC instructors can't emphasize enough how helpful the book is.

## Challenges
1. [Add it Up](1-add-it-up)
2. [Pad an Array](2-pad-array)
3. [Calculate the Mode](3-calculate-mode) *Mandatory Pairing Challenge*
4. [Group Research Methods](4-group-research-methods)
5. [Separate Numbers with Commas SOLO CHALLENGE](5-nums-commas-solo-challenge)
6. [Create Accountability Groups](6-acct-groups)
7. [Die Class](7-die-class)
8. [Technical Blog](8-technical-blog.md)
9. [Cultural Blog](9-cultural-blog.md)
10. [Accountability Group Check-in](10-accountability-group.md)
11. [BONUS Challenges](11-BONUS-challenges) *These are optional*

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU2W4.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Working through the Challenges
- Fork this (phase-0-unit-2) repository by clicking "Fork" at the top right of the page.
- Enable "issues" in the settings for the repo, like you did for phase-0-unit-1. This will allow people to give you feedback.
- Clone the `phase-0-unit-2` repository from the command line to your computer.

You will want to run and modify all files from your local repository on your computer. Use the terminal to navigate to the 'my_solution.rb' files or the spec files.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 2 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 2)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).

Solo challenges and GPS need to be complete the week they are due. There are no extensions granted for these challenges.
