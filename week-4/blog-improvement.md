# U2.W4: Blog Improvement - Add a Contact Page

## Learning Competencies
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins
- Use CSS to add and format colors, fonts, icons, images, etc.

## Summary:
Now that you've built your website and taken a little break with Ruby, it's important to review HTML and CSS so you can maintain your skills. We've integrated mini-challenges so you can continually practice and add to your website each week.

In this challenge, you will be adding your contact information to your website. This page will help others learn how to contact you.

You'll want to consider including the following:
- Email address
- Twitter handle
- Facebook Profile
- Linked In Profile
- GitHub
- Quora Account (if you use it)
- Any other social media or way to contact you.

You may want to use icons to represent each.

## Releases:

## Release 0: Consider
Where do you want to add this on your site? Did you include it in your original wireframe? If so, do you want to keep it there?

You can decide whether you want this to be housed on the home page or whether you want a whole separate page for it. If you want to go above and beyond, you can create a "contact me" form as a bonus that will email you when someone presses submit. If you search, you will find a lot of tutorials.

## Release 1: Add your information
If you've decided you need a new page, you'll want to create a new file in your [USERNAME].github.io repository called contact.html. Set up that page using HTML, and add your information to it.

If you've decided to add your information to an existing page, simply add the HTML there.

## Release 2: Apply CSS
View your page in the browser. How is your existing CSS formatting your page? Make modifications as necessary to improve the look of the page. You can go back and modify the HTML as necessary, just make sure you are relying on CSS to format the page.

## Release 3: Add a Link
If you created a new page, make sure people can find it from the home page!

## Release 4: Update your site
In week 3, you created a maintenance schedule for your site. Now is your time to work on those planned changes you wanted to create this week.

## Release 5: Commit, Push, and create a Pull Request!
Now that you've made all of your changes, commit them, and create a pull request to your repository. Merge your pull request to make it part of your site!

If you want to ask for feedback, please post on Twitter using the **#DBCU2W4** hashtag.

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) (Optional, but Highly encouraged).
