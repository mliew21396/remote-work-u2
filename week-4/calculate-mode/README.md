# U2.W4: Calculate the Mode Pairing Challenge

## Learning Competencies
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Implement a method based on pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Determine which data structure (arrays or hashes) to use based on challenge requirements


## Summary:

Write a method `mode` which takes an `Array` of numbers or strings as its input and returns an `Array` of the most frequent values.

If there's only one most-frequent value, it returns a single-element `Array`.

For example:

```ruby
mode([1,2,3,3])         # => [3]
mode([4.5, 0, 0])       # => [0]
mode([1.5, -1, 1, 1.5]) # => [1.5]
mode([1,1,2,2])         # => [1,2]
mode([1,2,3])           # => [1,2,3], because all occur with equal frequency
mode(["who", "what", "where", "who"]) # => ["who"]
```
HINT: You'll want to look at [`Hash`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Hash.html)es for this challenge.

## Release 0: Read
Before starting, read Chapter 9 (at least 9.3 again) and chapter 10 in the *Well-Grounded Rubyist.*

These chapters are a bit dense, but they will help your overall understanding of Ruby.

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 2: Write your [Initial Solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)

## Release 3: Run the tests
Once your code passes the tests, move on to refactoring.

## Release 4: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) your solution
Make sure your code still passes the tests!

## Release 5: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 6: Commit and Push!
If you want feedback, continue using **#DBCU2W4** to request it!

## Release 7: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) (Optional)
**Optional but HIGHLY encouraged!**
