# BONUS Challenges

Bonus challenges are optional and are here for you to continue with your learning should you have the time. All of the bonus challenges are excellent opportunities for you to improve your learning, so feel free to go back to earlier weeks and work on those bonus challenges.

We don't review bonus challenges often, so please give us immediate feedback if you see a problem with a bonus challenge on the Google+ Community.

Here are this week's bonus challenges:

- [Refactor: Pad an Array](pad-array-refactor)
- [Create a Reverse Polish Notation Calculator](reverse-polish-notation)
