# Week 5: Ruby Classes

Week 5 challenges will be published by 10:00am PST Monday morning.

<!-- This week you will work on solidifying your understanding of creating class objects in Ruby. You will also be focusing on the most basic form of testing, [driver test code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md).

The curriculum is designed to help you with the process of thinking through complicated problems. In order to develop this skill, make sure to follow each step  in each challenge (pseudocode, initial solution, driver test code, refactoring, reflection, and review).

This week gets into more advanced concepts, so make sure you pair as often as you need to ensure you are able to learn efficiently and have fun doing it! You can pair on any challenge (except for solo challenges) and you have an awesome community of programmers to pair with.

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU2W5.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Fetch DBC's Changes
####It's time to fetch changes from DevBootcamp's phase-0-unit-2 master repo.
Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md)!
Modify them for unit 2.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday at 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 2 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 2)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).

Solo challenges and GPS need to be complete the week they are due. There are no extensions granted for these challenges.

## Remember the Unit Expectations!

Expectation | Times per Unit | Times per Week
------------|----------|---------
[Peer-Pair](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/peer-pairing-sessions.md) | 6 | >= 2
[Give feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new) to GPS and peer pairs | 8 | >=2
Rate [feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) | 20 | 7

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on GitHub anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in Sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us know by posting on the community. Also try to figure out a fix and submit a pull request to correct the error. It will help your markdown and git skills!
