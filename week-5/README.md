# Week 5: Ruby Classes

Please do not start on week 5 yet, we will be reviewing the challenges and making changes. It will be published at least by the Friday before week 5 starts.

<!-- This week you will work on solidifying your understanding of creating class objects in Ruby. You will also be focusing on the most basic form of testing, [driver test code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md).

The curriculum is designed to help you with the process of thinking through complicated problems. In order to develop this skill, make sure to follow each step  in each challenge (pseudocode, initial solution, driver test code, refactoring, reflection, and review).

This week gets into more advanced concepts, so make sure you pair as often as you need to ensure you are able to learn efficiently and have fun doing it! You can pair on any challenge (except for solo challenges) and you have an awesome community of programmers to pair with.

You'll want to focus on reading the chapters 3 and 5 of The *Well-Grounded Rubyist* this week. You may also want to read chapter 4. We don't cover any of the topics from chapter 4 in Phase 0, but they are useful to be aware of.

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on GitHub anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in Sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us know by posting on the community. Also try to figure out a fix and submit a pull request to correct the error. It will help your markdown and git skills!
