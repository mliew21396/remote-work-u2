# Week 5: Ruby Classes

<!-- Please do not start on week 5 yet, we will be reviewing the challenges and making changes. It will be published at least by the Sunday before week 5 starts. -->

This week you will work on solidifying your understanding of creating class objects in Ruby. You will also be focusing on the most basic form of testing, [driver test code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md).

The curriculum is designed to help you with the process of thinking through complicated problems. In order to develop this skill, make sure to follow each step  in each challenge (pseudocode, initial solution, driver test code, refactoring, reflection, and review).

This week gets into more advanced concepts, so make sure you pair as often as you need to ensure you are able to learn efficiently and have fun doing it! You can pair on any challenge (except for solo challenges) and you have an awesome community of programmers to pair with.

If you are using the *Well-Grounded Rubyist* to solidify your learning, you'll want to focus on reading:
- Chapters 3 and 5
- Chapter 4 (We don't cover any of these topics in Phase 0, but they are useful to be aware of)
We can't recommend this book enough, so please get it if you can. Read through the Week 3 [BONUS challenge](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-1/blob/master/week-3/10-BONUS-challenges/Well-Grounded-Rubyist.md) for a discount code.

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU2W5.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Remember your Expectations for the Unit!
- Pair at least twice this week.  *You need to pair **6** times this unit*
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 7 pieces of feedback in this unit* (6 for peer-pairing, and 1 GPS)
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit.

## Fetch DBC's Changes
####It's time to fetch changes from DevBootcamp's phase-0-unit-2 master repo.
Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md)!
Modify them for unit 2.

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on github anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us by posting on the community, but also try to figure out a fix. It will help your markdown skills!


## Submitting your work

**You need to submit your work through on [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. When you log in, look at your profile page. There should be a "Unit 2 Week 5 Submission" form.** It is not enough to have your work on github.
