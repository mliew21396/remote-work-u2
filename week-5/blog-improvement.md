# U2.W5: Blog Improvement - Add "About" page

## Learning Competencies
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Format HTML elements using the CSS padding, borders, and margin properties
- Use CSS to add and format colors, fonts, icons, images, etc.

## Summary:
It's important to maintain your HTML and CSS skills, so we've integrated mini-challenges so you can continually practice and add to your website each week.

In this challenge, you will be adding a biography to your website. This will give viewers a little insight into who you are.

You may want to include:
- Where you are from
- Your interests/hobbies
- Educational Experiences
- Something quirky about you (This is a DBC tradition).

Ultimately, what you include is completely up to you. Think about who you want to visit your site and what they would want to know about you.

## Releases:

## Release 0: Consider
Who is your audience for this site as a whole? Is it different from the audience for this page? If so, how? Is there any way you can make them the same audience? Or do you need to re-think your audience in general?

What would that audience want to know about you?

## Release 1: New Page
In your [USERNAME].github.io repository, create a new page called about.html. Set up that page using HTML, and add your biography to it.

## Release 2: Apply CSS
View your page in the browser. How is your existing CSS formatting your page? Make modifications as necessary to improve the look of the page. You can go back and modify the HTML as necessary, just make sure you are relying on CSS to format the page.

## Release 3: Add a Link
Now that you have the page on your site, make sure people can find it from the home page!

## Release 4: Update your site
In a previous week, you created a maintenance schedule for your site. Now is your time to work on those planned changes you wanted to create this week.

## Release 5: Commit, Push, and create a Pull Request!
Now that you've made all of your changes, commit them, and create a pull request to your repository. Merge your pull request to make it part of your site!

If you want to ask for feedback, please post on Twitter using the **#DBCU2W5** hashtag.

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) (Optional, but Highly encouraged).
