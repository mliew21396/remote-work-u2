# U2.W5: Cultural Blog: Pairing and Giving Feedback

## Learning Competencies
- Identify one emotion that arose during a pairing session
- Describe kind, actionable, and specific feedback
- Discuss the feeling of vulnerability when pairing and reading feedback

## Summary
By now you should have submitted and received feedback from your pairing partners, so you'll be evaluating pairing, the feedback you've received, and how it felt to receive the feedback.

Remember to time-box to about an hour for each blog post.

## Release 0: Copy your Blog Template
In your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory, copy your blog template into a new HTML file named `c5-feedback.html`.

## Release 1: Read your feedback
Make sure to read the feedback you've received. You'll see it on the feedback dashboard in [Socrates](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback).

## Release 2: Write your Blog!

### Discuss (at least) the following in your blog post:
#### Pairing:
- What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
- Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
- Was something frustrating and difficult for you?

#### Feedback
- How did you feel when you read your feedback?
- Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
- Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to
do to improve next time you pair?
- How was it to write feedback?
- What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?

Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?

## Release 3: Publish
Link to your blog on the blog/index.html of your site and push your changes.
