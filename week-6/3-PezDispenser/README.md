# U2.W6: Create a PezDispenser Class from User Stories

## Learning Competencies
- Implement a basic Ruby class and identify when to use instance variables
- Translate driver code into a class structure using object-oriented design

## Summary
In this challenge, you will translate user stories into a Ruby object (using a class). If you aren't sure what a user story is, use the power of Google to do some research.

## Release 0: Review the User Stories:
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to "create" a new pez dispenser with a group of flavors that represent pez so it's easy to start with a full pez dispenser.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to easily count the number of pez remaining in a dispenser so I can know how many are left.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to take a pez from the dispenser so I can eat it.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to add a pez to the dispenser so I can save a flavor for later.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to see all the flavors inside the dispenser so I know the order of the flavors coming up.

## Release 1: Review the [Driver Code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md)
These do not have expectations that would return `true` or `false` if called.

## Release 2: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)
We definitely know we have a PezDispenser class, but what are its innards? What are PezDispenser's attribute(s) and method(s)? Take a moment to list out all the methods, and show the input and output. It's good to be clear when there isn't an input or output!

## Release 3: Write your [Initial Solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)
Make sure your test code still works and satisfies the expected output.

## Release 4: Write Tests
Using Driver Test code, write a couple tests to make sure your code works before you dive into refactoring.

## Release 5: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)

## Release 6: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 7: Push your solution to Github

## Release 8: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) (Optional)
**Optional but HIGHLY encouraged!**
