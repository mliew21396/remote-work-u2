# U2.W6: Create a Playlist from Driver Code

## Learning Competencies
- Implement a basic Ruby class and identify when to use instance variables
- Translate driver code into a class structure using object-oriented design

## Summary
Review the Driver Code included in the [solution](my_solution.rb) file and consider the following:

- What are the methods you need?
- Where do those methods belong?
- What should those methods do?
- How can you model real-world behavior through code?

Use Error-Driven Development (EDD) to solve the challenge. To do this you will need to run the code, find the error and write code that fixes that error. Repeat for each error you find. You shouldn't go into too much detail for each method until you've solved each error.

After you've fixed each error, you should have fun filling in each of the methods -- but don't forget to go through the normal steps in your coding revelry!

NOTE: The driver code references a method, `includes?`, which is not a typo. You should make your own `includes?` method.

## Release 0: Review the [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md)
Convert as many of the driver code examples into driver test code based on the way you want to implement each method.

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 2: Write your [Initial Solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)

## Release 3: Write Tests
Convert as many of the driver code examples into driver test code based on the way you implemented each method. Make sure your tests output `true` before refactoring!

## Release 4: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)

Make sure your tests are still working!

## Release 5: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 6: Push your solution to GitHub

## Release 7: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) (Optional)
**Optional but HIGHLY encouraged!**
