# U2.W6: Create a Bingo Scorer [SOLO CHALLENGE](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/solo-challenges.md)

## Learning Competencies
- Create, access and traverse nested data structures
- Implement a basic Ruby class and identify when to use instance variables

## Summary
This challenge will expand on the [bingo-solo-challenge](../week-5/5-bingo-solo-challenge) you did last week. First you accessed the two-dimensional array to find and replace the numbers called with x's. Now you want to write a program to look for any bingos. Start with a static board for testing, then add the random board generator from last week. When a bingo is found, the program should print "BINGO!" to the console.

A bingo in this exercise is a vertical horizontal or diagonal line of 5 x's.
```ruby
  [[47, 44, 71, 8, 88],
   ['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x'],
   [83, 85, 97, 89, 57],
   [25, 31, 96, 68, 51],
   [75, 70, 54, 80, 83]]
   # horizontal bingo

   [[47, 44, 71, 'x', 88],
   [22, 69, 75, 'x', 73],
   [83, 85, 97, 'x', 57],
   [25, 31, 96, 'x', 51],
   [75, 70, 54, 'x', 83]]
   # verical bingo

   [['x', 44, 71, 8, 88],
   [22, 'x', 75, 65, 73],
   [83, 85, 'x', 89, 57],
   [25, 31, 96, 'x', 51],
   [75, 70, 54, 80, 'x']]
   # diagonal bingo

   [[47, 44, 71, 8, 'x'],
   [22, 69, 75, 'x', 73],
   [83, 85, 'x', 89, 57],
   [25, 'x', 96, 68, 51],
   ['x', 70, 54, 80, 83]]
   # also a diagonal bingo
```
## Release 0: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)
Outline the logic necessary to check the bingo board for horizontal, vertical and diagonal bingos. Make sure your pseudocode is specific enough to be easily translated into code.

## Release 1: Write your [Initial Solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)
Translate your pseudocode into code.

## Release 2: Test
Write [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md) to test the different win cases. Try to find some board cases that break your code (false positive/negatives). This will allow you to refactor with confidence.

## Release 3: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)

## Release 4: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 5: Push your solution to Github

## Release 6: Other Win States (Optional)
There are lots of different ways to win Bingo.

Write methods to solve as many as you can!
