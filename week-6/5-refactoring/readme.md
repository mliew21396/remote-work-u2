# U2.W6: Refactoring for Code Readability


## Learning Competencies
- Explain what code is doing
- Refactor for clarity and readability

## Summary
Remember the credit card validator from last week? It's a doozy for most people. In this challenge, you've been provided with a passing solution. Your job is to refactor it  to achieve optimal readability. Remember, readable code isn't necessarily the shortest.

If you would like to do this twice, you may find another solution to refactor as well.

#### Goals of Readable Code
- Eliminate repetition by using looping and branching wisely
- Complex operations are decomposed into constituent parts
- Descriptive names for methods, variables, classes, and modules
- Methods are small and behavior is obvious
- Minimizes need for comments because the code tells you what it is doing
- Code is formatted with proper indentation for optimal readability

## Release 0: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 1: Comment the code
Comment each chunk of code in the original solution

## Release 2: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) the solution for readability

## Release 3: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 4: Push your solution to Github

## Release 5: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) (Optional)
**Optional but HIGHLY encouraged!**
