# U2.W6: Technical Blog Entry

## Learning Competencies
- Research Object-Oriented programming concepts

## Summary
You've learned a bit about object-oriented programming this week, but there is still a ton to learn. In this challenge, select one topic below and do a bit of research on it. Then write a blog post about what you learned. Remember to time-box about an hour for each blog post.

## Release 0: Copy the Template
In your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory, copy your blog template into a new HTML file named `t6-oop-concepts.html`.

## Release 1: Research
Select and research one of the topics below:

#### Option 1. OO vs. Functional Programming
So you've had some experience with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) this week. Some consider Functional programming the opposite of OO - compare them.

#### Option 2: Variable Scope
What kinds of variables does Ruby support? Where are they accessible? When would you use them and what makes them different?

#### Option 3: Class Methods
Research class methods and desribe what they are, how to use them, and when you would use them.

#### Option 4: Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas
What are these? How do they work?

#### Option 5: Classes vs Modules
Describe and explain the purposes of classes and modules. How are they similar? How do they compare?

#### Option 6: Inheritance vs Composition
What is Ruby inheritance? What is composition? Which have you used this week? Create your own examples to explain how to use each.

## Release 2: Blog it
Write a blog post that teaches your audience about the topic. Think of examples to use to teach and show your audience what you are describing.

## Release 3: Publish
Link to your blog on the blog/index.html of your site and push your changes.

## Release 4: Promote
Now it's time to show off your work and share your knowledge with your cohort-mates using Twitter!

Tweet your blog post using the hashtag **#DBCConcepts**.

## Release 5: Read
Read at least one other person's post on a topic you're interested in. Give the author A.S.K (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) feedback as an issue on their repo or a tweet!
