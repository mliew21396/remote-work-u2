# U2.W6: Stereotype Threat

## Learning Competencies
- Explain the symptoms and consequences of stereotype threat
- Create strategies for combating stereotype threat

## Summary
This week you will look into a new topic called stereotype threat. DBC is an amazing place, but it's also easy
to suffer from impostor syndrome or stereotype threat depending on your background. It's a good idea to learn a bit about these concepts to prepare yourself for the possibility. Remember to time-box to about an hour for each blog post!

## Release 0: Create the Template

In your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory, copy your blog template into a new HTML file named `c6-stereotype-threat.html`.

## Release 1: Research

Claude M. Steele has spent his life researching minority under-achievement and developed a theory called "Stereotype Threat." Conduct your own research about stereotype threat. Identify times when you felt it. How did it affect your achievement? What questions did you ask yourself? Did you feel it physically? If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine some groups that might? What could you do to help others in that situation?

## Release 2: Blog it!

In your post, describe your experiences with stereotype threat and how it affected you. Then identify what you plan to do when you feel stereotype threat or suspect someone else is feeling it. How will you create meaningful feedback or ask for feedback? How will you work to change the environment you're in to make it more welcoming? How will you address it in public?

Go into as much depth feels comfortable for you.
