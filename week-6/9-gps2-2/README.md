# U2.W5: Virus Predictor Pair Challenge


## Learning Competencies
- Identify and explain what code is doing
- Create, access, and traverse nested data structures
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops
- Define a method's responsibility
- Identify and rewrite repetitive code
- Explain `private` and discuss when it would be used

## Summary

The C.D.C. (Centers for Disease Control) is concerned about a recent form of deadly influenza. They've implemented the following program to predict the effect of the virus by state. Eventually they want to predict the spread of the virus, which is why that data is included.

The initial program is not very D.R.Y., but the program designer went on vacation and your boss needs the model to work efficiently so they can present their findings to Congress. You've been brought in to make the code more efficient and expandable for later features such as incorporating demographic data.

## Release 0: Run the code
Look at the output. Look at the input (it's in the other file). Explain what the program is doing.

## Release 1: `require_relative`
Write a comment explaining the require_relative statement - you should be somewhat familiar with this by now - it's in every `spec.rb` file. What does it do? How does it work?

## Release 2: Analyze `state_data`
Take a look at the `state_data` file. What is going on with this hash? What does it have in it? (HINT: There are two different syntax used for hashes here. What's the difference?) I refer to this giant hash as a "hashy hash;" why do you think that is?

## Release 3: Comment each method
Comment each method (above the method) and define its responsibility.

## Release 4: Implement a new feature!
Create a report for all 50 states, not just the 4 listed. Is there a D.R.Y. way of doing this? Does this belong in the class or outside of it? Why?

## Release 5: Refactor `virus_effects`
ONLY look at the `virus_effects` method and the two methods called inside it. (Do not look at `predicted deaths` or `speed_of_spread` themselves.) It's a short but deceptive method...

## Release 6: Private
What is the purpose of "private"? What happens if you move it above `virus_effects`?

## Release 7: Refactor!
Refactor the private methods `predicted_deaths` and `speed_of_spread`. How can you make them more D.R.Y.?

## Release 8: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)
