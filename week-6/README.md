# Week 6: Object-Oriented Design in Ruby

<!-- Week 6 challenges will be published at least by the Friday before the week starts. -->

Last week you started creating your own objects in Ruby. This week you will be working with something called Object-Oriented Design. We are asking students to purchase [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/) (affectionately pronounced "Poo-Dur") to help them with these ideas. Before you start the challenges this week, we recommend you read chapters 1 and 2. If you can, you should try to read the remainder of the chapters as you work through the challenges. If you don't have time to read the whole book, the most important chapters are 1-4 and 8. A lot of the material will probably go over your head, but you will be so happy to have read it before Phase 1 so all you have to do there is review. Try implementing the concepts as you work through challenges to help you understand and absorb the material.

You'll also want to read and review concepts in the *Well-Grounded Rubyist*. We highly suggest using the index often to help you find pertinent sections to read. If you haven't read all of the chapters listed in the [week 3 bonus challenge](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-1/blob/master/week-3/11-BONUS-challenges/Well-Grounded-Rubyist.md), make sure to read those.

Please keep track of the amount of time you spend reading this week. We will ask you to estimate it in the submission form.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday at 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 2 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 2)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).

Solo challenges and GPS need to be complete the week they are due. There are no extensions granted for these challenges.

## Fetch the curriculum changes!

It's time to fetch the new curriculum from Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-2. Make sure to check your directory before fetching changes! Use [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md). Change all instances of phase-0-unit-1 to phase-0-unit-2.

## Completing the challenges

Open your local version of the directory in Sublime. Make your changes, commit, and push as you complete challenges. Try using the command line as much as possible to navigate between directories and run files.

Make sure to include specific commit messages and push your changes each time you complete a challenge.
