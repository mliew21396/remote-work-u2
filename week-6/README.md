# Week 6: Object-Oriented Design in Ruby

Week 6 challenges will be published by 10:00am PST on Monday morning.

<!-- Last week you started creating your own objects in Ruby. This week you will be working with something called Object-Oriented Design and reading [*Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby*](http://www.poodr.com/) (aka POODR) ch. 1-4 within the context of the challenges. (We asked you to purchase this book in Unit 1). We don't expect you to understand and use all of the concepts listed, but we want you to know about them and be able to review in Phase 1 rather than read for the first time.

** These length estimates are calculated from past cohort averages and DO NOT include the reading (because this is a new part). 

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU2W6.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday at 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 2 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 2)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).

Solo challenges and GPS need to be complete the week they are due. There are no extensions granted for these challenges.

## Fetch the curriculum changes!

It's time to fetch the new curriculum from Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-2. Make sure to check your directory before fetching changes! Use [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md). Change all instances of phase-0-unit-1 to phase-0-unit-2.

## Completing the challenges

Open your local version of the directory in Sublime. Make your changes, commit, and push as you complete challenges. Try using the command line as much as possible to navigate between directories and run files.

Make sure to include specific commit messages and push your changes each time you complete a challenge.
