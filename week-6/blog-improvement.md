# U2.W6: Blog Improvement - Add a Resume

## Learning Competencies
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins
- Use CSS to add and format colors, fonts, icons, images, etc.

## Summary:
It's important to maintain your HTML and CSS skills, so we've integrated mini-challenges so you can continually practice and add to your website each week.

In this challenge, you will be adding your resume to your website. This page will be aimed at showing your employers your education history, work history, and skills.

## Releases:

## Release 0: Consider
How do you want to present your resume? Do you want it to look like a paper resume? What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing that?

Also consider what your audience will hope to see on your resume. For fun, see what some [creative people](http://www.businessinsider.com/best-tech-resumes-2013-11#this-woman-created-a-cool-sliderocket-presentation-to-get-herself-a-job-at-a-startup-called-ridejoy-7) put together.

Don't worry, it's ok to have a normal resume on your site, but you can also feel free to mix it up and have fun.

## Release 1: New Page
In your [USERNAME].github.io repository, create a new page called resume.html. Set up that page using HTML, and add your information to it.

## Release 2: Apply CSS
View your page in the browser. How is your existing CSS formatting your page? Make modifications as necessary to improve the look of the page. You can go back and modify the HTML as necessary, just make sure you are relying on CSS to format the page.

## Release 3: Add a Link
Now that you have the page on your site, make sure people can find it from the home page!

## Release 4: Update your site
In a previous week, you created a maintenance schedule for your site. Now is your time to work on those planned changes you wanted to create this week.

## Release 5: Commit, Push, and create a Pull Request!
Now that you've made all of your changes, commit them, and create a pull request to your repository. Merge your pull request to make it part of your site!

If you want to ask for feedback, please post on Twitter using the **#DBCU2W6** hashtag.
