# U2.W6: Stereotype Threat

## Learning Competencies
- Explain the symptoms and consequences of stereotype threat
- Create strategies for combating stereotype threat

## Summary
This week you will look into a new topic called stereotype threat. DBC is an amazing place, but it's also easy
to suffer from impostor syndrome or stereotype threat depending on your background. It's a good idea to learn a bit about these concepts to prepare yourself for the possibility. Remember to time-box about an hour for each blog post.

## Release 0: Copy the Template

In your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory, copy your blog template into a new HTML file named `c6-stereotype-threat.html`.

## Release 1: Research

Claude M. Steele has spent his life researching minority under-achievement and developed a theory called "Stereotype Threat." Conduct your own research about stereotype threat.

## Release 2: Blog it!

In your post, discuss what stereotype threat is and consider whether you can identify times when you have been impacted by it. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your own personal experiences, try to think of situations that may trigger stereotype threat outside of the examples you researched.

Consider how affected your achievement or how it could impact someone else's achievement (if you are not sharing personal experiences)?

If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine how it would feel to? If you thought others were suffering from it, what could you do to help others in that situation? Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat?

Go into as much depth as feels comfortable for you. Again, if you're not comfortable sharing your own experiences, please apply what you've learned by coming up with some situations where others might feel it.

If you would prefer to answer different questions entirely, please feel free to do so within the context of stereotype threat.
