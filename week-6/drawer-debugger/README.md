# U2.W6: Drawer Debugger

## Learning Competencies
- Use error messages to correct syntax mistakes and/or drive development
- Define a method's responsibility
- Explain how classes interact with one another
- Identify the use of Object-Oriented Design principles

## Summary

You will run into numerous error messages as a developer, so it's important to know what they mean and how to read them. The messages provide valuable information on where your program is having problems, but sometimes the messages are misleading, especially if you have little practice interpreting them. In this challenge, you need to work through the error messages until the program runs properly.

## Release 0: Read
Read the following chapters of POODR:
- Ch. 1: Object-Oriented Design
- Ch. 2: Designing Classes with Single Responsibility

Once you read these chapters, identify how the code either uses, or fails to use these principles.

## Release 1: Indent and debug the program
Before you can really start debugging you'll want to indent the code properly.

Run the code from the console. You should encounter 8 errors before it will run completely. Read each error carefully and fix it using **the minimum amount** you need and keeping with the single responsibility principle from POODR. Only one error should be fixed by adding code to the driver code. For everything else, you should only modify the classes.

## Release 2: Test!
Write tests using [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md).

## Release 3: Call it again (x3)
Interact with the code by writing at least three more different method calls. Did they return what you expected?

## Release 4: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)
Now it's time to refactor the code based on the principles you learned in chapter 1 and 2 of POODR. Are there any horrible violations of these principles? If so change them and add a comment that explains your reasoning. If you think they adhere to the principles, add a comment above the method that explains why you think so.

## Release 5: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 6: Push your solution to GitHub

## Release 7: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) **Required! Read and give feedback for at least 2 other solutions.**
