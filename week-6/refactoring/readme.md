# U2.W6: Refactoring for Code Readability


## Learning Competencies
- Explain what code is doing
- Refactor for clarity and readability

## Summary
Remember the credit card validator from last week? It's a doozy for most people. In this challenge, you've been provided with a passing solution. Your job is to refactor it to achieve optimal readability keeping in mind readable code isn't necessarily the shortest.

#### Goals of Readable Code
- Eliminate repetition by using looping and branching wisely
- Complex operations are decomposed into constituent parts
- Descriptive names for methods, variables, and classes
- Methods are small and behavior is obvious
- Minimizes need for comments because the code tells you what it is doing
- Code is formatted with proper indentation for optimal readability

## Release 0: Comment the code
Comment each chunk of code in the original solution

## Release 1: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) the solution for readability

## Release 2: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 3: Push your solution to Github

## Release 4: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) (Optional)
**Optional but HIGHLY encouraged!**
