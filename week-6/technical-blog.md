# U2.W6: Technical Blog Entry

## Learning Competencies
- Research Object-Oriented programming concepts

## Summary
You've learned a bit about object-oriented programming this week, but there is still a ton to learn. In this challenge, select one topic below and do a bit of research on it. Then write a blog post about what you learned. Remember to time-box about an hour for each blog post.

## Release 0: Copy the Template
In your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory, copy your blog template into a new HTML file named `t6-oop-concepts.html`.

## Release 1: Research
Select and research one of the topics below:

#### Option 1. OO vs. Functional Programming
So you've had some experience with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) this week. Some consider Functional programming the opposite of OO - compare them.

#### Option 2: Variable Scope
What kinds of variables does Ruby support? Where are they accessible? When would you use them and what makes them different?

#### Option 3: Class Methods
Research class methods and desribe what they are, how to use them, and when you would use them.

#### Option 4: Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas
What are these? How do they work? Procs and Lambdas are very rarely used at your stage of learning, but they are good to learn about. You should try to be comfortable with blocs by the end of Phase 0.

#### Option 5: Classes vs Modules
Describe and explain the purposes of classes and modules. How are they similar? How do they compare?

#### Option 6: Inheritance vs Composition
What is Ruby inheritance? What is composition? Which have you used this week? Create your own examples to explain how to use each. See the [BONUS challenges](BONUS-challenges) for another challenge that addresses these concepts.

## Release 2: Blog it
Write a blog post that teaches your audience about the topic. Think of examples to use to teach and show your audience what you are describing.

## Release 3: Publish
Link to your blog on the blog/index.html of your site and push your changes.

## Release 4: Promote
Now it's time to show off your work and share your knowledge with your cohort-mates using Twitter!

Tweet your blog post using the hashtag **#DBCConcepts**.

## Release 5: Read
Read at least one other person's post on a topic you're interested in. Give the author A.S.K (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) feedback as an issue on their repo or a tweet!
